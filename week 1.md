# data products
* facilitate end-goal through use of data
* doesn't present data to users
* leverage data to provide actionable functionality

# analytics
* called Business Intelligence
* creating summarizatiosn and trends

# new analytics
* making recommendations
* implementing recommendations, learn from outcomes, and then optimize
* needs to happen real time instead of a batch process

# data products
* guiding users to make a specific decision

# challenges
* **data quality**
* **data quality**
* **data quality**
* *product validation*
* *product validation*
    * does it have the outcome that is desired
    * how to adjust the outcome to the desired
*  infrastructure

# data quality
* highly unstructured data


# requirements
* has to work in the context of the user
* users comfotrable the way you are using the data
* users in control of the decision
* *softer side* of data products

# project 1
pick a feature from a website and answer the following:

* part a
    * the feature
    * the data
    * the outcome
    * the complexities
    * the validation
* part b
    * find and pick at least 5 datasets

# elementary statistics
1. variables - describe characterstics of an individual in a population
    * columns
    * numeric
        * continous - comes froms all possible numbers
        * discrete - comes from a specific set of numbers
    * categorical
          * ordinal - order matters
          * nominal - order doesn't matter
    * univariate - single dimension
    * multivariate - multiple dimensions
1. parameters
    * details about all values in a population
1. statitics
    * details about a population based on a sample set
1. summary statics
    * arithmetic mean - balance point
    * median - middle magnitude
        * half are above and half are below
    * mode - most common
        * what occurs most
1. other
    * counts - count how many times categorial values occur
    * proportions - the count out of the total count of observations - adds to 1
    * percentage - proportion adding to 100
1. quantiles
    * where does a observation rank in total measurements
1. five number summary
    * 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th 
    * min, 1st, median, 3rd, max
    * easily see if data is scewed one way or the other
1. variance
    * how does the data deviate from the mean
    * std deviation
        * on average how close are we to the mean
1. variable relationships
    * covariance - how do 2 variable varry in relation to each other
        * positive - moving together
        * negative - moving apart
        * zero - no relationship
    * correlation
        * interpreting covariance
        * range of -1 - 1 closer to 1 indicates a stronger correlation
1. outliers
    * data that doesn't fit
    * what do you do with strange data
    * might have a bad sample, should it be ignored

# elementary data visualization
1. barplots
    * counts across variables
1. piecharts
    * easily see proportions
1. histogram
    * barchart grouped by ranges
1. boxplots
    * five number summary
1. scatterplot
    * show relationship between 2 variables
