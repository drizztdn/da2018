## linear regression

describe the effect that a particular variable might have on the value on a continuous outcome variable

**explanatory/independent variable** - the variable wich affects the other
**response/outcome/dependent variable** - the outcome variable

linear regression model is to come up with a function that estimates the mean of one variable given the value of another variable - ***not for exact answers***

Y | X is "The value of Y is conditional upon the value of X"

is the slope is 0 then the predictor has no impact on the response.

**least squares regression **- minimizes the average squared distance between the observed data and itself

**residual** is the distance between the observation and the fitted line

## confidence & prediction of intervals

**confidence interval** - how confident you are that the mean lies between an upper and lower bound

**prediction interval** - how confident you are that the actual individiual value lies between an upper and lower bound

### interpolation vs extrapolation
a prediction is an **interpolation** if it falls within the range of observed data
a prediction is an **extrapolation** if it falls outside the range of your observed data


## multiple linear regression

multiple sources of influence on a value, what is the combined effect of variables on a result

## model details

**residual standard error** - indicates the standard deviation of the residuals (root mean square of the residuals)

**r-squared** - is a statistical measure of how close the data is to the fitted regression line.
**r-squared** = explained variation/total variation
